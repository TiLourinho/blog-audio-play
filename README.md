3. **Post Update/Delete**: Users should be edit and delete posts as needed;
4. **Styling**: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Node.js & Express**: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express. Express will handle routing and middleware;
2. **EJS**: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
