    "description": "In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. After breaking into the mainstream with their previous album, Nevermind (1991), Nirvana hired Steve Albini to record In Utero, seeking a more complex, abrasive sound that was reminiscent of their work prior to Nevermind. Although the singer and primary songwriter Kurt Cobain claimed that the album was \"very impersonal\", many of its songs contain heavy allusions to his personal life and struggles, expressing feelings of angst that were prevalent on Nevermind.\r\n\r\nThe album was recorded over two weeks in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. After recording finished, rumors circulated that DGC might not release the album due to Albini's abrasive and uncommercial sound. The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig to achieve a more desirable sound for both Nirvana and their label. The band later hired the producer Scott Litt to remix the singles \"All Apologies\", \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"Pennyroyal Tea\".\r\n\r\nIn Utero was a major critical and commercial success upon release. Critics praised the album's raw, unconventional sound and Cobain's lyricism. It reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart; \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" reached number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The album has been certified 6× Platinum in the US for 6 million sales and has sold 15 million copies worldwide. It was the final Nirvana album released before Cobain's suicide in 1994, six months after the album's release. \"Pennyroyal Tea\", planned as a single prior to Cobain's death, was released in 2014 and reached number one on the now-defunct Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart."
