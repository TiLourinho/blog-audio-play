    "description": "Bleach is the debut studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on June 15, 1989, by Sub Pop. After the release of their debut single 'Love Buzz' on Sub Pop in November 1988, Nirvana rehearsed for two to three weeks in preparation for recording a full-length album. The main recording sessions for Bleach took place at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington between December 1988 and January 1989. It is the only Nirvana album released on the Sub Pop label and their only studio album to feature drummer Chad Channing. Bleach did not chart upon initial release but was well received by critics. When reissued internationally by Geffen Records in 1992 following the breakthrough success of Nirvana's second album, Nevermind (1991), Bleach peaked at number 89 on the Billboard 200, number 33 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 34 on the Australian albums chart. In 2009, Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary edition of Bleach featuring a live recording of a 1990 Nirvana performance in Portland, Oregon as bonus material. Bleach had sold 40.000 copies in North America before the release of Nevermind. It has since been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than 1.9 million copies in the United States alone. It is Sub Pop's best-selling album to date and is unlikely to be surpassed by competitors. Frontman Kurt Cobain's death in April 1994 also led to a resurgence in the album's popularity, reaching number one on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. In April 2019, Bleach was ranked No. 13 on Rolling Stone's list of the '50 Greatest Grunge Albums'."

    "content": "In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. After breaking into the mainstream with their previous album, Nevermind (1991), Nirvana hired Steve Albini to record In Utero, seeking a more complex, abrasive sound that was reminiscent of their work prior to Nevermind. Although the singer and primary songwriter Kurt Cobain claimed that the album was \"very impersonal\", many of its songs contain heavy allusions to his personal life and struggles, expressing feelings of angst that were prevalent on Nevermind.\r\n\r\nThe album was recorded over two weeks in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. After recording finished, rumors circulated that DGC might not release the album due to Albini's abrasive and uncommercial sound. The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig to achieve a more desirable sound for both Nirvana and their label. The band later hired the producer Scott Litt to remix the singles \"All Apologies\", \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"Pennyroyal Tea\".\r\n\r\nIn Utero was a major critical and commercial success upon release. Critics praised the album's raw, unconventional sound and Cobain's lyricism. It reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart; \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" reached number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The album has been certified 6× Platinum in the US for 6 million sales and has sold 15 million copies worldwide. It was the final Nirvana album released before Cobain's suicide in 1994, six months after the album's release. \"Pennyroyal Tea\", planned as a single prior to Cobain's death, was released in 2014 and reached number one on the now-defunct Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart."

    "content": "Core is the debut studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released by Atlantic Records on September 29, 1992.\r\n\r\nProduced by Brendan O'Brien, Core became a massive commercial success, reaching number three on the Billboard 200 by July 1993 and has since been certified 8× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned four hit singles including \"Sex Type Thing\", \"Wicked Garden\", \"Creep\", and \"Plush\": the latter reached number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks, with the music video receiving heavy rotation on MTV. Stone Temple Pilots would go on to win two awards for \"Plush\": an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.\r\n\r\nThe album initially received poor reviews despite its commercial success; the band was criticized for allegedly copying the musical style of other alternative acts, particularly Pearl Jam. Retrospectively, Core has been acknowledged as a seminal release of the alternative rock and grunge movement of the early 1990s. Core helped propel Stone Temple Pilots into the mainstream and remains their most commercially successful record. A 25th anniversary deluxe edition was released in 2017."
